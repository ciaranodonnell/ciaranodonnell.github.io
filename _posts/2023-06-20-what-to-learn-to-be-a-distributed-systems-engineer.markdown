I was asked a question recently by a colleague I used to work with which I have answered quite a few times to quite a few different people. 
The question was:
> I want to pick your brain and get some insights from you, how do you go about upskilling yourself? How do you decide which topics are relevant? How do you go about building side projects?
> 
>My goal is to be of tech lead level by end of year. I would like to build expertise in distributed systems & backend development.

I thought for answering this I would take a leaf out of Scott Hanselman's book and write the answer as a blog post. (I did also answer it directly when it was asked).

## Backend engineering

First, I'll get this out of the way, I didnt really answer much about Backend engineering.
This really is just programming business logic.
There are other topics like code structuring, dependency injection, http codes, 


I will answer the questions a little bit out of order as I think it will be easier to read that way. 

## 1. How do I decide what topics are relevant



about what they should learn to grow as a backend / distributed systems engineer.
