I have been working from my home for over 2 years now, since I moved from New Jersey to North Carolina. While I lived in NJ I was able to work from home but I wasn't set up for it. I didn't have a home office, I would work from my dining table which was open to the front room and the kitchen. With kids, TVs, cooking etc, this was a, to put it nicely, sub-optimal experience.

When I moved to Charlotte I was going to be working from home by default so I wanted to make sure I was setup for it this time. We bought a house in South Charlotte and I made sure it had a real office room I could put a real desk in. I also got 1GB fiber optic internet, and some monitors to increase my virtual desktop space a little. One thing I also decided to do, because I like to use them problem solving, was to get myself a nice big whiteboard in my new home office.

The difference was night and day! I had improved everything from my previous situation and I couldn't be happier. I have been working this way for the last 2 years now and it's generally been ok. However, recently I've started to feel less satisfied. My monitors weren't at the right height and I felt a little hunch backed, I started to have probems with my webcam (the FaceTime HD drivers in BootCamp apparently aren't a high priority for Apple). and I started to feel like I should be doing better.

Then a few weeks ago, [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/) put up a [new blog post](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/GoodBetterBestCreatingTheUltimateRemoteWorkerWebcamSetupOnABudget.aspx) that showed the setup he has at home to make sure that his working from home doesn't negatively impact his work and relationships and Microsoft. That post was the impetus I needed to start looking at upgrading what I was doing.

I decided to set about getting my problems fixed with my home setup, and I ordered some things to make life better. I got monitor mounts to raise my screens to a more comfortable position. I got a new microphone to improve the sound quality for my on Teams calls, and recording videos and presentations. I also got some equipment to turn my DSLR camera (a Canon T5i) into a webcam. I got a power strip with 16 outlets and a powered USB3.0 hub with 16 USB ports too.

I am in a much better position now and I think, for me, it was worth the money. I put together [a YouTube video that shows the before and after](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-ofhpscuEE) and what I have. I intend to put a few more together to more in depth review the things that I bought and how they work.

This year I also plan to start putting more public facing content on this blog and my YouTube channel, which was a secondary purpose to the upgrades.

This is the finished product at the end of my initial setup.
