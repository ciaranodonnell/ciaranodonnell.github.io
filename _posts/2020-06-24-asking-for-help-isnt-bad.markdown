# Asking for help isn't a bad thing

I have worked on a large number of teams and a large number of projects. Throughout all of that experience I have learnt many technologies, lots of patterns and practices, and have learnt to solve a lot of challenges.

Nowadays I am in a central role leading Avanade's Center of Excellence.
My main role is to help people across the company with their software architecture problems.
I do this across projects from pre-sales (while we're creating initial solution ideas for a clients), and through project delivery.

My entire team at Avanade is there is help people when they need it. 


## Why do people need help?

I am willing to go out on a limb and say *Everyone needs help sometimes*!

First off though, I am going to talk about how Companies need help.
We working in the Systems Integrator Consulting business.
Our business is to help people when they encounter problems they don't have the capacity or desire to solve on their own. 
Normally there is a lack of experience, sometimes a lack of developers or other skills to get them through a period of high work volume, often both.

I try to make it clear to my clients that it is NOT a bad thing for them to need our help.
It should be expected.
We work with banks, retailers, Healthcare providers, payers, manufacturers, insurers, and many other types of business.
They are generally good at their business, some of them are the best in their industry.
But there is no reason they should expect to be the best at Microservices, or Azure platform technology, or Digital Transformation.
It isn't their business, it's not what they're supposed to be good at.
It **is** our business and we do have a lot of experience doing it.
We go to work everyday trying to make sure we do these things every day.

So our clients shouldn't feel insecure about asking for help.
They should be empowered by the fact that they are mature enough to realize that they aren't going to be the experts at everything.

So, I started with *Companies* but what about *People*?

People need help too. For the same reasons companies do.
We can all only be expected to be familiar in the things we have worked in before, to the extent we have worked in them.

Lots of engineers I meet feel like they should be able to go it alone.
They group up so many things as "Software Development" or "Architecture" and they feel like that's their job, they should be good at it.
But Software Development and Architecture are huge and nuanced fields that there is no one person that can know everything.



I have noticed that with a lot of my colleagues, especially the ones that lead the Center of Excellence for Azure Platform technologies, there is more of a culture of people asking for help. 

## Software is kinda unique

One  of the main things I have noticed throughout my career being 'front line' delivery/implementation as well as in this CoE role, is that people
