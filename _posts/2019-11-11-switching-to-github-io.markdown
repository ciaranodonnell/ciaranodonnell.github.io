Over the last few months I have tried out a number of different blogging options from self hosting to hosted services. 
First let me tell you a little bit about those and then I will talk about moving to Github.io for hosting.

## My old blog
A long time ago in a galaxy far far away I had a blog. I think I started it in about 2005 or 2006. Its where I got the title 'wanna be developer'. The first post on that blog was about wanting to be one of the great 'teacher' developers. This was a wordpress.com based blog, the url was/is [http://wannabedeveloper.wordpress.com](http://wannabedeveloper.wordpress.com). The most recent post was during Build 2012 when Windows 8 launched. 

In the interim i have amde other attempts to get into the community. However i have always had the same kind of problems keeping it going. The first and most prominent of those what that I didn't think I had a useful contribution to make. There were peeople going on .NET Rocks and talking about big frameworks and I felt that my voice wasn't going to be useful in the same crowd as those. Working at a consulting firm meant the cool stuff I did was proprietary and secret so it would have just been opinions. 

## Doubling down on social
About a year ago my role changed and I took a leadership role for Avanade in North America. I am not the leader of our Software Architecture Center of Excellence. As a group we are charged with helping sales (as all groups in consulting firms normally are) but, perhaps more importantly, 'Technical Enablement'. That means that while an important part of my role is solving customer problems, it is also to do training and create recommendations for people across the company. 

Over the last year I have been creating this training and enablement content and at first, it was close to my least favorite activity in my role. I felt the same pressure I had felt for years, that it was crazy that I would have something to teach all of Avanades 20+ thousands of consultants. However I have come to learn an important lesson:

**Everyone has something to contribute!** 

I've had the benefit of working on a number of unique projects over my career with some very challenging requirements. 
I may not have built big frameworks that everybody used but I have built some interesting systems 
and learned a lot of things along the way. That experience is unique. 
The learnings are valuable and the perspectives I have can be useful to other people. 
Not everything I create will be gold, and some of it might be a little wrong, 
but by creating it I am taking part in the conversation.
Scott said in his [Being a social developer](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/84134?source=sessions) 
talk from Ingite 2019 last week something along the lines of "dont be scared to be wrong. Being wrong means you get two 
blog posts for one, the original one and the one where you admit to being wrong and explaining your learning".

This is the way I am approaching everything now. I hope I am right in the stuff I put out, but I am willing to be wrong,
to accept that I dont know everything, and I want to learn, even if that happens in public. 
I went to Ignite last week, and I have been to a few Build conferences before, and each time I do I realize the enormous
amount of things I don't know. I turning that thought into opportunity instead of impedement now.

So enough of my rambling about this crap, let's talk tech:

## What blog engines have I tried?

1. [Hosted Wordpress](www.wordpress.com)
2. [Self Hosted Wordpress](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/WordPress.WordPress)
3. [DotNetNuke](https://www.dnnsoftware.com/)
4. [BlogEngine.Net](http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/)
5. [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) ([self hosted on azure](https://adamtheautomator.com/running-ghost-on-azure/))
6. [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/)
7. [Github Pages](github.io)

Why did I try so many? I think I was looking for a set of specific requirements which I neglected to think about first. 
I didn't know what other bloggers experiences were, or what technology they were using, but I wanted something to be easy.
I think I was looking for something that:

1. Looked kinda cool and professional
2. Was easy to create content for
3. Could have posts, pages, comments, and analytics
4. I could keep the content accessible to myself
5. Had a good editing experience
6. Was extensible: I could build on top of or had plugins for other cool features
7. Was cheap or better yet free

## Hosted WordPress

This is the first thing I tried.
