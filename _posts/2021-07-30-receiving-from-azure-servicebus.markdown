## More Information

I've been creating a series of videos on building message driven systems and Azure Service Bus. Check it out here:
[Building Message Driven Systems Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57Qr9tk6Uxc&list=PLj1Z4NiDbwIOkkPvM2HFbMMPb9Lr1B_Oj)

The source code for the examples in that series can be found in this Github repository [https://github.com/ciaranodonnell/AzureDemos/tree/master/AzureServiceBus/](https://github.com/ciaranodonnell/AzureDemos/tree/master/AzureServiceBus/)
