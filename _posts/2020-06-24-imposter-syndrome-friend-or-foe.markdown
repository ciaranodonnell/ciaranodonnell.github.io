Imposter syndrome is one of the challenges of modern software engineering, and probably tech in general. Lots of people have it, and they all wish they didnt, but I might argue it's not all that bad.

## What is Imposter Syndrome?

First lets take a look at what wikipedia says about it:
 
 >Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon, impostorism, fraud syndrome or the impostor experience) is a psychological pattern in which one doubts one's accomplishments has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud".
 <br><br>Despite external evidence of their competence, those experiencing this phenomenon remain convinced that they are frauds, and do not deserve all they have achieved. Individuals with impostorism incorrectly attribute their success to luck, or interpret it as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent than they perceive themselves to be. <br><br>While early research focused on the prevalence among high-achieving women, impostor syndrome has been recognized to affect both men and women equally.

They way i think about imposter syndrome is as an opposite to the Dunning-Kruger effect.
Which is:

>In the field of psychology, the Dunningâ€“Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability. It is related to the cognitive bias of illusory superiority and comes from the inability of people to recognize their lack of ability. Without the self-awareness of metacognition, people cannot objectively evaluate their competence or incompetence.

So the Dunning-Kruger effect can be summarized (at least by me) as what happens when someone is so ill-informed and uncapable in a field that they fail to understand the limits of their ability. 

This is the opposite of Imposter Syndrome, which I summarize as what happens when someone is informed enough, and capable enough to realize the size of the field they're working in and understand the amount of things they don't know.

I dont think thats the real psychological summary, but I think that's really what the cause of people using the term in tech is.

## What's bad about imposter syndrome?

Imposter Syndrome is largely thought of as undesirable.
My personal belief is that this is because it is, or can be, a source of great anxiety for the people that experience.

Constantly being in fear of someone discovering you're a fraud is stressful.
Anticipating the moment that someone catches you out, or that you fail publicly and suffer ridicule or repurcussions because of it generates this anxiety.

The in-ability of people to realize their own competence is bad.
There are lot of people I have met the suffer from this and don't realize the quality they have and the value of their experience.
They judge themselves by the knowledge and experience they *don't* have, not what they *do* have.
