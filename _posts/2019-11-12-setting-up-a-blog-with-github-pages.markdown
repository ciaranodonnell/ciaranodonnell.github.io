While there is a pretty good walk through of the GitHub Pages on [https://github.io](https://github.io), it really focuses on how to setup GitHub to publish your site. 
I found that there was slightly more knowledge needed to get to get it all working how I wanted it on my windows development machine. 
While i was going through this process I should have been taking notes and screenshots, but I didn't. 
I normally don't arrive at a perfect destination in one go so its hard to make that work. Anyway, this is pretty much what I did to get to the end state of a working blog.

## Setting up Github

First you need a Github account. If you don't have one, go sign-up. I caution you though that your github account name will be the thing people see when they find you
on github and also it will be in the URL for your blog, so choose wisely.
