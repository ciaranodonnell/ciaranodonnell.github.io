Digital Transformation is one of hot buzzwords at the moment but it means many different things to many different people. I've been working with people on business and digital transformation for nearly a decade now and I have been trying to find a way to standardize the definition to help people understand what we are aiming for and what the journey is like. 

In order to explain Digital Transformation we should take a look at what a 'non-transformed' business looks like, what it struggles with, and why it wants to tranform. Then we can look at what changes businesses need to make to achieve that transformation.

## What's normal?

Whenever you try to define normal, you're really trying to capture the center of a bell curve.
While there are always exceptions, there is a large group of people near the middle with similar characteristics.

Most business have some fundamental processes they follow to achieve their business outcome. They typically have been working that way for years.
They will have adopted technology over the last few decades and used it to facilitate how they work.
They may have got CRM or ERP systems, perhaps websites with online ordering capability, or digital payment and receipt capabilities.

Through the last few decades there has been a pendulum swing between custom software, which was the only choice in the early decades of computing, and commerical off the shelf software (COTS).

This shift to off the shelf software has made this culture that 'the Business' does the business, and IT just supports them in various ways, desktop support, Office productivity software, application management, and software development.
Chargeback IT models have reinforced this idea, that Business and IT are seperate, independent concerns.

The business asks for software to meet its requirements, IT gets tasked with a project to meet that requirement, either with COTS, or custom software. 
Even as, more recently in this more digtal age, the pendulum has been swinging back towards the side of custom software over COTS, it's IT that has taken on the increase Software Engineering work because it's "technical stuff, not business stuff".

The Digital Transformation pressures businesses are feeling now are increasing.
The pace of technology revolution has increased. Consumer (and employee) expectations are constantly rising thanks to trends like the "consumerization of IT".
Business now have agility challenges, they need to adapt to the evolving demographics - millenials. Those that can't adapt fast enough are losing relevance, and some are even dying.

A natural consequence of the contention between businesses wanting change and IT wanting stability, supportability, platform re-use etc has been "Shadow IT".
Business groups creating their own 'IT' has increased to handle this, driven by Cloud and SaaS platforms that enable them to get software without tradition IT concerns.
Shadow IT is almost always frowned upon as its dangerous/disruptive/insecure/badly managed, and normally ends up being merged into the traditional IT groups eventually.

## Whats the Desire

Businesses now want to change, to evolve to a new way of working.
They want to be like the startups that are disrupting their core business or other industries.
They want to be able to differentiate their services and create unique and compelling experiences for their customers and their employees.


They are looking for the results that things like Agile,Lean Startup, and Open Source promise:

- They want to be able to make decisions faster
- bring products to market faster
- Tighten the OODA cycle so they can act on feedback and pivot faster 

They want to 'do Digital Transformation', they are being told thats the way to evolve, in some cases survive.


## Whats the trouble?


The challenge they have is understanding what that **really** means. 
They dont have a clear idea what's different between themselves and the industry disruption success stories.
"What do they do differently?", "What causes the startup to be successful?".
These are challenging questions for established businesses to get to grips with.

Many times they have invested in 'digital', they have their CRM systems or their website, they are 'digital' assets.
So that begs the question: "What's the tranformation part?", "Do we need a Digital Organization?", "Do we need an Innovation Organization?".


Existing established businesses also have challenges startups don't:
  - Existing customers that need supporting
  - Existing organization structures that people like and are comfortable with
  - Existing leaders who know how the busines works and dont know how digital works - they play to their strengths
 
The combination of all these challenges creates an *inertia* - they find it hard to move the business towards any goal.


## Common 'Go Digital' Strategies

There are a number of common ideas that I have seen people jump to. I've boiled them down to this list when I've ordered from bad to better:

#### Get a new website / CRM / ERP

This doesnt really transform anything. It's a new digital asset but it normally supports the same business processes.
It normally takes some time to get these things live, and while they're being built the requirements can evolve like they did to the last iteration.

#### Go Agile

Doing software development in an agile way will have benefits. If they do it well and really adopt the mindset, it can have a lot of benefits. However most of the times I have seen IT departments go agile, it's really waterfall planning with a planning session every 'sprint' to decide which bit to do next.

So really, changing the way a team in IT organizes its todo list can provide localized benefit, but still isnt transformative

#### Establish an Innovation group

Innovation Teams are not a really new idea now, they have been common for a decade maybe. They are often some new group of people, with a charismatic leader and some strong technologists, that get tasks with 'innovation'.
What's often lacking are things like success criteria, or plans for adopting output back into the business.

The best outcomes I've seen from these are new point solutions, kiosks or mobile apps, that have cool interfaces or fix something for the business, but end up like a COTS product installed by traditional IT, and sometimes never getting another version as the innovation team has moved on to another product so they eventually get shutdown.

Innovation teams sound good to the board/the street but how do you bring the innovation back to the business.

#### Get a Digital Group

The 'Digital group', increasingly led by new Chief Digital Officers is a more recent version of the Innovation group. 
Digital groups are often tasked with 'Digital Transformation'.
Too Often they end up working between the business and the IT group, finding niches areas in the business process where 'digital' can have an impact. Creating similar point solutions or one-offs that Innovation groups did. Perhaps with a larger permanent staff of User Experience and Engineering they can do better at the support and maintenance of their solutions. 

#### Create an internal startup to disrupt yourself

This is by far the coolest sounding idea, and a much bigger bet than any of the others and it works well where i've seen it done properly. 
You basically get people to make a startup version of your own company. 
They work to create differentiated business processes, to create digital only versions of your non-digital or hybrid-digital offerings. They are separate from the traditional business and IT teams and have some autonomy over their business and technology choices. 

Where I've seen this fail is when people bring it back into the main business. 
They hand the new digital thing to the old non-digital business which uses it's existing mental models to run that new business. 
When this happens the 'magic' of the new bit fades away over time.

I think they work when you move the old non-digital business to the start-up.
They cannibalize the old business units and migrate the business itself to the new systems and processes. 
This is a much harder task and the inertia we talked about before fights this all the way.


So if these aren't the optimal strategies, what is Digital Transformation?


## What is Digital Transformation?

My definition of Digital Transformation

> A business is digitally transformed when there is no separation between the business structure, and the digital systems that operate that business. 

I think when business get to this point, they are one structure that achieves the business outcome. 
That structure is one org chart, with the overriding metrics of success being attaining the business goals

- This means there is no 'Business + IT' group. There is a business group. That business group operates the business entirely, including the software that supports it. 
- They dont have a process, and then adapt some COTS to it. 


I think in a Digital Business, there is no Chief Digital Officer, at least not as standard alone. If the CDO runs and organization that does something important, it means that important thing (normally providing some technology solution) is not part of the business, which breaks our definition. 

So a Digital Transformation is really about **cultural change**. It's about the way to think about technology as part of the business. 


## So how do you get there?

This is the hard part, changing cultures involves many things

- Software Engineering becomes a business concern, its not shadow IT, its business oriented software
  - Software engineers need to think about business challenges and solutions, not technologies first.
- Businesses have to develop their own products, even when they use COTS, its their product

- Get software engineering to be truly DevOps and Agil enabled. 
  - Dont metric on LOC, User Stories complete etc
  - Metric on sales, reviews, sign-ups etc, whatever the business is trying to do.
  - Create an open by default culture.
    - People in businesses talk. They collaborate, and they share.
    - People in these business should too, and coz its one team the business and software engineers should be doing that too.
    - references: Azure DevOps / Office 365 teams - metrics on customer usage



## Software Patterns that support it

- Open by default software
- API first
- Domain Driven Design
- Integration through Events
- Microservices thinking

- Caveat is that matrixing organizations for tech skills and tech communities makes sense. But the "WE" that is building software or the "WE" that does the business operations are both the same, all inclusive WE

- Also, some stuff like email, printers etc, remain a common IT function. Possible with a better like Technology Facilities

- I predict that in 30 years time, good business wont even have IT departments anymore. 'Big lump of IT' thinking will be gone. It will be business software in the cloud, and facilities will include the printers and cabling.
