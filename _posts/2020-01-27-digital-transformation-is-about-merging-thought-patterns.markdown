Digital Transformation is one of hot buzzwords at the moment but it means many different things to many different people. I've been working with people on business and digital transformation for nearly a decade now and I have been trying to find a way to standardize the definition to help people understand what we are aiming for and what the journey is like. 

In order to explain Digital Transformation we should take a look at what a 'non-transformed' business looks like, what it struggles with, and why it wants to tranform. Then we can look at what changes businesses need to make to achieve that transformation.

## What's normal?

- Whenever you try to define normal, you're really trying to capture the center of a bell curve. 
- Most business have some fundamental process. They have been working that way for years
- They have adopted digital technology over the last few decades and used it to facilitate how they work. 
  - This is CRM, ERP, Websites with ordering capability, etc
- Through the last few decades there has been a pendulum swing between custom software (only choice in the early days) and COTS
- This shift to off the shelf software has made this culture that the Business does the business, and IT just supports them in some way.
- Chargeback IT models have created this similar idea, that Business and IT are seperate and can operate independently. 
- As the pendulum has been coming a little more back to the side of Software Engineering recently, software development has been included in IT as its technical and computer based. 

- The pace of technology revolution has increased. 
- Business now have agility challenges, and those that cant adapt fast enough are dying
- Shadow IT has sprung up in a large number of business to handle this, but its almost always frowned upon as its dangerous/disruptive/insecure/badly managed.

## Whats the Desire

- businesses now want to change
- they want to be like the startups that are disrupting them
- They dont all know how to compete in that world or what it really means. 
- But they want all the promises that they see in Agile, Open Source, Lean Startup and the rest. 
- They want to do 'Digital Transformation', they are being told thats the way to survive

## Whats the trouble?

- they have 'digital' - their CRM or their website
- so whats the tranformation part?
  - Do we need a Digital Organiation?
  - Do we need an Innovation Organization?
- Existing companies have problems startups dont
  - Existing customers that need supporting
  - Existing organization structures that people like and are comfortable with
  - Existing leaders who know how the busines works and dont know how digital works
- All of their problems create an inertia - they find it hard to move the business


## Solutions

- Get a new website / CRM / ERP
  - This doesnt really transform anything
- Go Agile
  - Changing the way a team in IT organizes its todo list can provide localized benefit, but still isnt transformative
- Get an Innovation arm
  - These sound good to the board/ the street but how do you bring the innovation back to the business
- Get a Digital Arm
  - See Innovation Arm
- Create an internal startup to disrupt yourself
  - This is by far the coolest sounding idea, and it works well where i've seen it done properly. 
  - You basically get people to make a startup version of your own self.
  - Where i've seen this fail is when people bring it back into the main business. 
  - They hand the new digital thing to the old non-digital business
  - I think they work when you move the old non-digital business to the start-up

So if these aren't the total solutions, what is Digital Transformation?


## What is Digital Transformation?

My definition of Digital Transformation

> A business is digitally transformed when there is no separation between the business structure, and the digital systems that operate that business. 

I think when business get to this point, they are one structure that achieves the business outcome. 
That structure is one org chart, with the overriding metrics of success being attaining the business goals

- This means there is no 'Business + IT' group. There is a business group. That business group operates the business entirely, including the software that supports it. 
- They dont have a process, and then adapt some COTS to it. 


I think in a Digital Business, there is no Chief Digital Officer, at least not as standard alone. If the CDO runs and organization that does something important, it means that important thing (normally providing some technology solution) is not part of the business, which breaks our definition. 

So a Digital Transformation is really about **cultural change**. It's about the way to think about technology as part of the business. 


## So how do you get there?

This is the hard part, changing cultures involves many things

- Software Engineering becomes a business concern, its not shadow IT, its business oriented software
  - Software engineers need to think about business challenges and solutions, not technologies first.
- Businesses have to develop their own products, even when they use COTS, its their product

- Get software engineering to be truly DevOps and Agil enabled. 
  - Dont metric on LOC, User Stories complete etc
  - Metric on sales, reviews, sign-ups etc, whatever the business is trying to do.
  - Create an open by default culture.
    - People in businesses talk. They collaborate, and they share.
    - People in these business should too, and coz its one team the business and software engineers should be doing that too.


## Software Patterns that support it

- Open by default software
- API first
- Domain Driven Design
- Integration through Events
- Microservices thinking

- Caveat is that matrixing organizations for tech skills and tech communities makes sense. But the "WE" that is building software or the "WE" that does the business operations are both the same, all inclusive WE

- Also, some stuff like email, printers etc, remain a common IT function. Possible with a better like Technology Facilities

- I predict that in 30 years time, good business wont even have IT departments anymore. 'Big lump of IT' thinking will be gone. It will be business software in the cloud, and facilities will include the printers and cabling.
