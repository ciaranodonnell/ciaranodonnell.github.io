For a long time I have been working with clients and helping them with their "Digital Transformation" agendas.
In every one of those conversations we have come to a question along the lines of "How long to I need to keep paying for this effort?".
My answer to this questions is always the same, although I try and phrase it for each client to understand: "As long as you want to continue getting the benefit!".
This always becomes a conversations about transformation, and digital products, and lots of other related concepts that are hard for people to get their head around.
To me, a technologist who isn't actually schooled in business or economics, it always seemed kinda obvious how it worked, but for the client, there ways always a challenge for them to get to grips with it.

What I really lacked through all of this was a coherrent way to explain what I meant, or a good mental model for how my world view differed from their world view.
Without a good mental model, I certainly fell short of having the language to express it.
