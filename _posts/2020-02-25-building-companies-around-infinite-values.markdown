A few weeks ago, while at work, a friend sent me a link to a video called [How to Make a Cultural Transformation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9d0NqSztWA).
I watched it, and I liked it.
I'd never heard of Simon Sinek before.
The video is an abbreviation of a longer talk he had given about cultrual change, and the [Law of Diffusion of Innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations).
He talks about how you use that law to target your efforts to Innovators and Early Adopters, which leads to transformation efforts crossing the tipping point where the majority will follow.
Its a **great** video and I strongly recommend you watch it.

Anyway, I watched the video I was sent and YouTube did it's job of presenting me with a list of other videos featuring Simon Sinek.
I liked the way he presented and I wanted to hear what else he had to say.
The next video I watched was called [Be an Infinite Player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbYzF6Zy5tY). The videos full title claims it to be "one of the best speeches ever".
That's not an usually 'clickbaity' title for YouTube so left judgement till I watched it.

Well holy shit!
While I have not seen nearly enough speeches to agree its one of the best ever, I did think it was very powerful.
The idea of the Infinte Game was amazing.
It's not the first time I had thought such thoughts.
