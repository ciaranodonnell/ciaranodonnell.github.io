# How are good Technologists like gems?

I've been leading a Center of Excellence for technology architecture for a few years now at Avanade, and before that I was a lead of Architecture at Infusion.
Throughout that time I have been tasked many times with finding people to join a group of leaders in the architecture space.

We I use archtiecture in these terms, what I am talking about is the ability for technologists to create solutions to real business problems.
Both of these companies were/are consulting firms. Infusion was a much smaller one when acquired by Avanade.

Recently I have been tasked again with helping to explain how we grow, and perhaps hire, people that can solve real business problems, not just with a specific technology, but with whatever the best set of technologies might be.

## The search for an analogy

Also recently (perhaps the last 2-5 years), there has been a drive in the technology industry to recognize that people come from different backgrounds, and that the background and the route to the tech industry is not a good indicator of quality or performance.

I fully agree with this, despite the fact I am probably the traditional type of person with a traditional path (I am white, british, and have a Comp Sci degree).
So I have been trying to find a way to describe the fact that it's not the origin of a person we want to hire for, it's the potential.
